2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF/IBUF (in Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_vip/u_digital_recognition/col_area_reg[0]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_vip/u_digital_recognition/col_area_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell u_vip/u_digital_recognition/col_area_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_vip/u_digital_recognition/col_area_reg[1]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_vip/u_digital_recognition/col_area_reg[1]_i_1/O, cell u_vip/u_digital_recognition/col_area_reg[1]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_vip/u_digital_recognition/col_area_reg[2]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_vip/u_digital_recognition/col_area_reg[2]_i_1/O, cell u_vip/u_digital_recognition/col_area_reg[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_vip/u_digital_recognition/row_area_reg[0]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_vip/u_digital_recognition/row_area_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell u_vip/u_digital_recognition/row_area_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_vip/u_projection/num_col0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_vip/u_projection/num_col_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell u_vip/u_projection/num_col_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_vip/u_projection/nxt_state is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_vip/u_projection/FSM_onehot_nxt_state_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell u_vip/u_projection/FSM_onehot_nxt_state_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
